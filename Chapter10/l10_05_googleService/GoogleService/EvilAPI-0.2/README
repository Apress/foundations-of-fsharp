EvilAPI 0.2

    In response to Google's discontinuation of support for their SOAP Search
    API, we have created the EvilAPI. The EvilAPI supports most of the same
    SOAP calls that Google's SOAP Search API supports -- it just
    doesn't use their deprecated API to get the data. Instead, it uses page
    scraping. Evil? Maybe. But not nearly as evil as providing a powerful
    development tool to people who are loyal to Google and then
    discontinuing it without any warning or regard to their users.


    EvilAPI is a gateway that translates your SOAP calls into requests to
    Google's web interface, scrapes the result pages and packages the
    data back to you via SOAP. It's written in Perl and makes use of
    SOAP::Lite and LWP::UserAgent, both of which are available from a CPAN
    mirror near you.

    
INSTALLING THE GATEWAY

    The gateway takes the form of two files, gateway.pl and GoogleSearch.pm.
    gateway.pl is the SOAP end-point where SOAP calls will be directed to.
    These calls will be handled by the code in GoogleSearch.pm.
    
    Installing the gateway on your own server simply requires putting
    gateway.pl somewhere on a web server and putting GoogleSearch.pm
    somewhere in your perl INC path.
    
    As currently written, EvilAPI operates as a CGI script, though it's
    trivial to convert it to use mod_soap. All you need to do is decipher
    SOAP::Lite's docs.


USING THE GATEWAY
    Recoding clients to use the gateway is trivial: you merely have to
    change the SOAP end-point to the URL for your EvilAPI server installation.
    Clients using the GoogleSearch.wsdl file will need to change the line
    
        <soap:address location="http://api.google.com/search/beta2"/>
        
    Just replace the google.com address with whatever URL your EvilAPI install
    can be found at and everything should go smoothly.
    
    Clients should read the next two sections carefully.


THINGS THAT CURRENTLY DON'T WORK:
    
    *) The documentFiltering, searchComments, searchTips and
        directoryCategories attributes on GoogleSearchResult objects.
    *) The hostName attribute on ResultElement objects

    
THINGS THAT WILL NEVER WORK:
    Because the web interface doesn't provide all the information the SOAP API
    did, it is not possible to emulate some functionality.
    
    *) The restrict and filter arguments to doGoogleSearch
    *) The directoryCategory, directoryTitle, summary and
        relatedInformationPresent attributes on ResultElement objects
